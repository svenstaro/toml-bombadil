When you keep changing your working environment like this you end up with several problems :\n\nSome symlinks will end up orphans.\nNot every program you use support Xresources and you will most probably have to manually edit some themes/config.\nWhen starting a fresh installation you will very likely need to adapt your existing dotfiles to your new machine.\nIt is a mess!\n\nToml Bombadil try to solve this with a simple addition to the symlink method used by other tools:\ninstead of creating a symlink from a dotfile to the actual config path of a program, it will create a copy of it and\nsymlink the copy. This additional step allow to use your original dotfile as a template and inject variables in the copy.\nYou can have multiple value files in the same dotfile repository and change color scheme, or any value on the fly.\nWhile Toml Bombadil has all those features available you could start using it only to generate symlinks and templatize\nyour dot file progressively.\nAlternatives\nThe awesome-dotfiles\nrepo maintain a list of dotfile managers.\nBefore writing Toml Bombadil, I was using dotbot, it's easy to configure and simple to use.\nI wanted something a bit more configurable but chezmoi felt way too complicated.\nIf you want the heavy artillery, chezmoi is probably what you are looking for.\nQuick Start\nOne page summary of how to get Toml Bombadil up and running.

Currently, you can install it via cargo,\nthe rust package manager, or via the Arch User Repository if you use an Arch based distro.\nCargo\ncargo install toml-bombadil\n\nArchlinux\npacman -S toml-bombadil\n\nGetting started\nSetup\nIf you already have some dotfiles on a git repository, no need to start from scratch:\ngit clone https://github.com/my_org/dotfiles\n\n1. Add a bombadil config to your dotfiles\ncd my_dotfiles &amp;&amp; touch bombadil.toml\n\n2. Linking bombadil :\nFor Bombadil to be able to run from any directory and use different config files we need to symlink its config to\n$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/bombadil.toml:\nbombadil install my_dotfiles/\n\n⚠️ : Toml Bombadil will generate a copy of your dotfiles under .dots. If you use git to manage your dotfiles,\nyou need to add .dots to your .gitignore.\nConfiguration\nToml Bombadil obviously uses the toml configuration format. here is a sample configuration :\n# {dotfiles}/bombadil.toml\n\n# Path to your dotfiles relative to your $HOME directory\ndotfiles_dir = \"my_dotfiles\"\n\n[settings]\n# An array of toml files paths containing the variables to inject in your templatized dotfiles\n# You can have multiple var files as long as variable names does not colide.\nvars = [ \"vars.toml\" ]\n\n# An array of post install shell commands\nposthooks = [ \"sway reload\" ]\n\n[settings.dots]\n\n# A dot entry representing a symlink, `source` is relative to `dotfiles_dir`\n# and `target` shall be relative to $HOME directory or absolute.\nsway = { source = \"sway\", target = \".config/sway\" }\n\n# You can have as many dot entry as you want, linking files or directories\nalacritty = { source = \"alacritty.yml\", target = \".config/alacritty/alacritty.yml\" }\n\nOnce you are satisfied with your config, you can install your dotfiles:\nbombadil link\n\nClean up\nIf you want to remove symlinks generated by Toml Bombadil run the following:\nbombadil unlink\n\nWorkflow\nToml Bombadil behave slightly differently than other dotfiles managers: your dotfiles will not be directly symlinked\nto their target locations. Instead, Toml Bombadil will create a copy of your dotfiles under .dots and then symlink\nthose copy.\nThe idea behind this is to inject variables into your dotfiles and allow you to compose various themes and profiles.\nBecause of this, you will need to reload your dotfiles with bombadil link whenever you make change.\nA convenient way to work with Toml Bombadil would be to add a keyboard shortcut for bombadil link in your window manager.\nGoing further\nSo far we have covered the basic on how to install and symlink your dotfiles, but Toml Bombadil as many more features.\n","id":"https://oknozor.github.io/toml-bombadil/docs/getting-started/quick-start/","title":"Quick Start"},"https://oknozor.github.io/toml-bombadil/docs/hooks/":{"body":"","id":"https://oknozor.github.io/toml-bombadil/docs/hooks/","title":"Hooks"},"https://oknozor.github.io/toml-bombadil/docs/hooks/hooks/":{"body":"Default profile hook\nHooks are defined under the default profile section in Bombadil's configuration.

Assuming we are using sway as a window manager, and our terminal is allacritty, \nwe are going to define three separate variables files : \n\nA global variable file theme_vars.toml\nA variable file
